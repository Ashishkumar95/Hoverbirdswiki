=============================================
Welcome to hoverbirds's documentation Wiki!
=============================================

This wiki is a work in progress and will contain user as well as developer documentation for all our products. We don't differentiate between developer and user. Most of products are aligned with education and research community, they are all developers. 

We try to keep it up to date. But if you come across any errors please let us know at support@hoverirds.in. We will try our best to resolve it. 
Alternatively you can fix it yourself in Github repo, we will happily merge your pull requests.

Autonomous Robotics Research Platforms
=======================================
We love putting Raspberry Pi in our robots. It adds incredible value to the platforms with very little hardware cost. 

Our first product is RW460 but we will keep adding more and more products based on the same overall hardware and software components.
